# 🚀 React Redux Featured App

This is a modern React app bootstrapped with **Vite** that showcases:

- ✅ Lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `<Suspense>`
- ✅ Routing with `react-router-dom`
- ✅ State management using **Redux Toolkit**
- ✅ API fetching using **Axios** + `createAsyncThunk`
- ✅ Simple structure, easy to scale
